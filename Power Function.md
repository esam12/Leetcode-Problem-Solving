# Power Function Implementation in Python: Naive vs Optimized Approach

This document outlines two different implementations of the power function `myPow(x, n)` in Python: a **naive recursive approach** and an **optimized recursive approach** using divide-and-conquer. We'll compare the two methods, explain their limitations, and highlight why the optimized solution is superior and accepted by platforms like LeetCode.

## Problem Summary
The goal is to calculate the power of a number `x` raised to `n` (`x^n`).
1. If `n == 0`, the result is always `1.0`.
2. If `n < 0`, compute `1 / x^|n|`.
3. Handle large inputs efficiently, minimizing recursion depth and ensuring acceptable runtime performance.

## Naive Recursive Approach
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def myPow_naive(self, x, n):
        """
        Naive recursive approach for calculating power.
        This implementation is inefficient and can cause maximum recursion depth exceeded errors.
        """
        # Base case: Any number raised to power 0 is 1
        if n == 0:
            return 1.0
        # If n is negative, invert the result by calculating for positive power
        if n < 0:
            return 1 / self.myPow_naive(x, -n)
        # Recursive calculation (inefficient for large n)
        return x * self.myPow_naive(x, n - 1)
```

### Drawbacks
1. **Excessive Recursion**:
   - Each recursive call decreases `n` by `1`, leading to `O(n)` recursive calls.
   - For large `n` (e.g., `1000`), this exceeds Python's recursion depth limit (~1000 by default).
2. **Inefficient for Negative Powers**:
   - When `n < 0`, the function calls itself with `-n` and adds additional computation overhead.
3. **Runtime Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity: `O(n)`
   - Space Complexity: `O(n)` (due to call stack).

## Optimized Recursive Approach
### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def myPow_optimized(self, x, n):
        """
        Optimized recursive approach for calculating power using divide-and-conquer.
        This method is efficient and prevents excessive recursion depth.
        """
        # Base case: Any number raised to power 0 is 1
        if n == 0:
            return 1.0
        # Handle negative powers by taking reciprocal
        if n < 0:
            return 1 / self.myPow_optimized(x, -n)

        # Divide and conquer: calculate power for n // 2
        half = self.myPow_optimized(x, n // 2)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return half * half  # If n is even
        else:
            return half * half * x  # If n is odd
```

### Benefits
1. **Efficient Recursion**:
   - Uses divide-and-conquer to reduce `n` by half in each step, requiring only `O(log(n))` recursive calls.
   - Handles large inputs like `n = 10^9` without exceeding recursion depth limits.

2. **Improved Runtime Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity: `O(log(n))`
   - Space Complexity: `O(log(n))` (due to call stack).

### Why Accepted by LeetCode?
The optimized solution is suitable for large test cases often presented in coding challenges. It processes inputs like `x = 2, n = 10^9` within milliseconds due to its efficient runtime.

## Comparison
| Feature                | Naive Approach         | Optimized Approach      |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Recursion Depth        | `O(n)`                | `O(log(n))`             |
| Time Complexity        | `O(n)`                | `O(log(n))`             |

| Handles Large Inputs   | Fails for large `n`   | Efficiently handles     |
| Negative Powers        | Works, but slow       | Handles efficiently     |

## Test Cases
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()

    # Naive Approach Tests
    print("Naive Approach:")
    try:
        print("2^3 =", solution.myPow_naive(2, 3))  # Expected: 8
        print("2^-2 =", solution.myPow_naive(2, -2))  # Expected: 0.25
    except RuntimeError as e:
        print("Naive approach failed:", e)

    # Optimized Approach Tests
    print("\nOptimized Approach:")
    print("2^3 =", solution.myPow_optimized(2, 3))  # Expected: 8
    print("2^-2 =", solution.myPow_optimized(2, -2))  # Expected: 0.25
    print("2^1000 =", solution.myPow_optimized(2, 1000))  # Large power, efficiently handled
```

## Key Takeaway
The naive approach is a good starting point for understanding recursion, but the optimized solution demonstrates how divide-and-conquer significantly improves performance, making it the preferred method for real-world applications and coding challenges.
